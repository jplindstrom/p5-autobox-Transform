{{$NEXT}}

  * Documentation improvements to go with new "reject", "reject_by",
    "reject_each" methods


1.033 2019-06-19T20:15:20Z

  * Doc fixes


1.032 2019-06-19T19:22:20Z

  * New @array method: ->reject,      the opposite of Array->filter
  * New @array method: ->reject_by,   the opposite of Array->filter_by
  * New @array method: ->reject_each, the opposite of Array->filter_each


1.031 2017-11-09T00:48:09Z

  * Improved POD documentation


1.030 2017-11-08T23:42:36Z

  * Document simple case for group_by $value_sub

  * New @array methods ->group, ->group_count, ->group_array


1.029 2016-10-24T22:09:19Z

  * @array->to_hash, and %hash->to_array


1.028 2016-10-23T20:18:46Z

  * Even more docs improvements for ->order, ->order_by.


1.027 2016-10-23T17:41:02Z

  * POD fixes for order, order_by
  * Other docs improvements


1.026 2016-10-23T16:58:04Z

  * New feature: sorting using @array->order and @array->order_by.


1.025 2016-10-13T12:18:59Z

  * Document %hash->filter_each to make it official.


1.024 2016-10-12T21:00:44Z

 * ->filter and ->filter_by now takes a dwim predicate
   which can be one of: subref (returns true), string (eq), regex
   (=~), hashref (key exists).

   Arrayref (in) and undef (is) will annoyingly have to wait until the
   old call style is removed in 2.000 .


1.023 2016-10-10T21:46:35Z

 * Officially rename all "grep"-related methods to "filter" something,
   to open up for a new $array->filter() method which is more capable
   than autobox::Core's $array->grep(). There are aliases for all
   existing grep-methods.

   All grep-related methods will continue to work: they are not
   deprecated and will probably never go away.

 * Simple $array->filter($subref) method.


1.022 2016-10-09T20:11:29Z

 * POD fixes and documentation improvements


1.021 2016-10-09T19:33:10Z

 * The new call style for accessors is now the preferred one, the old
   one deprecated but still supported until 2.000 .

   If you have code with the old call style, please pin your version
   to < 2.000 in your cpanfile, dist.ini or whatever you use.


1.020 2016-10-09T15:15:22Z

 * Support for new call style for accessor method calls with arguments
   e.g. ->map_by([ price_with_discount_code => $code ])


1.019 2016-08-21T19:32:42Z

 * Minor POD fixes


1.018 2016-08-21T18:55:54Z

 * Array->to_ref, Hash->to_ref, Array->to_array, Hash->to_hash.
   Use these e.g. as a nicer way to enfore scalar or list context.

 * Use autobox::Core inside of autobox::Transform, so that e.g. String
   autobox methods can be used in a map_by


1.017 2016-07-25T11:53:06Z

 * Allow empty $args arrayref when accessing hash keys


1.016 2016-07-23T15:50:32Z

 * Improved docs


1.015 2016-07-23T15:27:10Z

 * Make $hash->map_each_value() official by documenting it.

 * grep_by can now take a $grep_subref to check if each item should
   remain (default: check for true values).


1.014 2016-07-21T17:02:10Z

 * map_each_value Hash method (so far undocumented)


1.013 2016-07-19T12:29:41Z

 * Change version required to 5.010, hopefully closing #3. Thanks to
   https://github.com/findmo for reporting.

 * Make $hash->map_each(), $hash->map_each_to_array() official by
   documenting them.


1.012 2016-07-07T17:10:47Z

 * Require perl 5.10, to avoid bogus test failures on unsupported
   versions. This resolves issue #2: Fails with perls < 5.10


1.011 2016-07-07T12:57:42Z

 * Rename Hash grep -> grep_each, grep_defined -> grep_each_defined
   - This is why they're undocumented

 * map_each, map_each_to_array Hash method (so far undocumented)


1.010 2016-06-04T06:59:49Z

 * grep, grep_defined Hash methods (so far undocumented)


1.009 2016-06-05T21:24:57Z

 * More doc improvements, examples


1.008 2016-06-04T16:51:58Z
