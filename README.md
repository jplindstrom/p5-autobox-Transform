# NAME

autobox::Transform - Autobox methods to transform Arrays and Hashes

# SYNOPSIS

    # These are equivalent ways to transform arrays and arrayrefs

    ### map_by
    my @genres = map { $_->genre() } @$books;
    my @genres = $books->map_by("genre");

    my $genres = [ map { $_->genre() } @$books ];
    my $genres = $books->map_by("genre");

    # With sum from autobox::Core / List::AllUtils
    my $book_order_total = sum(
        map { $_->price_with_tax($tax_pct) } @{$order->books}
    );
    my $book_order_total = $order->books
        ->map_by(price_with_tax => [$tax_pct])->sum;


    ### grep_by
    my $sold_out_books = [ grep { $_->is_sold_out } @$books ];
    my $sold_out_books = $books->grep_by("is_sold_out");

    my $books_in_library = [ grep { $_->is_in_library($library) } @$books ];
    my $books_in_library = $books->grep_by(is_in_library => [$library]);


    ### group_by

    $books->group_by("genre"),
    # {
    #     "Sci-fi"  => 3,
    #     "Fantasy" => 1,
    # },

    $authors->group_by(publisher_affiliation => ["with"]),
    # {
    #     'James A. Corey with Orbit'     => 1,
    #     'Cixin Liu with Head of Zeus'   => 1,
    #     'Patrick Rothfuss with Gollanz' => 1,
    # },

    my $genre_books = $books->group_by( "genre", undef, []->gather_sub );
    # {
    #     "Sci-fi"  => [ $sf_book_1, $sf_book_2, $sf_book_3 ],
    #     "Fantasy" => [ $fantasy_book_1 ],
    # },


    #### flat
    my $prolific_author_books = [ map { @{$_->books} } @$authors ]
    my $prolific_author_books = $authors->map_by("books")->flat

# DESCRIPTION

Note: This module supercedes autobox::Array::Transform which was
unfortunately named.

High level autobox methods you can call on arrays, arrayrefs, hashes
and hashrefs e.g. map\_by(), grep\_by(), group\_by()

## Raison d'etre

[autobox::Core](https://metacpan.org/pod/autobox::Core) is awesome, for a variety of reasons.

- It cuts down on dereferencing punctuation clutter.
- It makes map and grep transforms read in the same direction it's executed.
- It makes it easier to write those things in a natural order. No need
to move the cursor around a lot just to fix dereferencing, order of
operations etc.

autobox::Transform provides a few higher level methods for mapping,
greping and sorting common cases which are easier to read and write.

Since they are at a slightly higher semantic level, once you know them
they also provide a more specific meaning than just "map" or "grep".

(Compare the difference between seeing a "map" and seeing a "foreach"
loop. Just seeing the word "map" hints at what type of thing is going
on here: transforming a list into another list).

The methods of autobox::Transform are not suitable for all
cases, but when used appropriately they will lead to much more clear,
succinct and direct code, especially in conjunction with
autobox::Core.

## Examples

    my $total_order_amount = $order->books
        ->map_by(price_with_tax => [ $tax_pct ])
        ->sum;

    my $order_authors = $order->books
        ->map_by("author")
        ->map_by("name")->uniq->sort->join(", ");

## List and Scalar Context

All of the methods below are context sensitive, i.e. they return a
list in list context and an arrayref in scalar context, just like
autobox::Core.

When in doubt, assume they work like `map` and `grep`, and convert the
return value to references where you might have an unobvious list
context. E.g.

    $self->my_method(
        # Wrong, this is list context and wouldn't return an arrayref
        books => $books->grep_by("is_published"),
    ),

    $self->my_method(
        # Correct, convert the list to an arrayref
        books => [ $books->grep_by("is_published") ],
    ),
    $self->my_method(
        # Correct, ensure scalar context i.e. an array ref
        books => scalar $books->grep_by("is_published"),
    ),

# AUTOBOX ARRAY METHODS

## map\_by($method, @$args?) : @array | @$array

Call the $method on each item in the list. Like:

    map { $_->$method() }

Examples:

    my @ahthor_names = $authors->map_by("name");
    my $author_names = @publishers->map_by("authors")->map_by("name");

Optionally pass in @$args in the method call. Like:

    map { $_->$method(@$args) }

Examples:

    my @prices_including_tax = $books->map_by("price_with_tax", [ $tax_pct ]);
    my $prices_including_tax = $books->map_by(price_with_tax => [ $tax_pct ]);

## grep\_by($method, @$args?) : @array | @$array

Call the $method on each item in the list. Like:

    grep { $_->$method() }

Examples:

    my @prolific_authors = $authors->grep_by("is_prolific");

Optionally pass in @$args in the method call. Like:

    grep { $_->$method(@$args) }

Examples:

    my @books_to_charge_for = $books->grep_by("price_with_tax", [ $tax_pct ]);

## group\_by($method, @$args = \[\], $value\_sub = count) : %key\_value | %$key\_value

Call ->$method(@$args) on each object in the array (just like ->map\_by)
and group the return values as keys in a hashref.

The default $value\_sub gives the count of each value as the values of
the hashref.

Example:

    my $genre_count = $books->group_by("genre");
    # {
    #     "Sci-fi"  => 3,
    #     "Fantasy" => 1,
    # },

### The $value\_sub

This is a bit tricky to use, so the most common thing would probably
be to use canned utility subs which do common things (see below).

The hash key is whatever is returned from $object->$method(@$args).

The hash value is whatever is returned from

    my $new_value = $value_sub->($current_value, $object, $key);

where:

- $current value is the current hash value for this key (or undef if the first one).
- $object is the current item in the list. The current $\_ is also set to this.
- $key is the key returned by $object->$method(@$args)

### \[\]->gather\_sub

This is a utility method to collect all the objects into an array for
the hash values. Example:

    my $genre_books = $books->group_by( "genre", undef, []->gather_sub );
    # keys: genre string
    # values: arrayref with the Book objects in $books for each genre string

Note: the undef is to avoid calling "genre" with any arguments.

Note: the slightly weird way of calling \[\]->gather\_sub is just a
sneaky way to call the gather\_sub in the autobox::Transform
namespace without exporting anything (the empty array is not actually
used for anything).

## flat() : @array | @$array

Return a flattened array, assuming the array items themselves are
array refs. I.e.

    [
        [ 1, 2, 3 ],
        [ "a", "b" ],
    ]->flat

returns

    [ 1, 2, 3, "a", "b "]

This is useful if e.g. a map\_by("some\_method") returns arrayrefs of
objects which you want to do further method calls on. Example:

    # ->books returns an arrayref of Book objects with a ->title
    $authors->map_by("books")->flat->map_by("title")

Note: This is different from autobox::Core's ->flatten, which reurns a
list rather than an array and therefore can't be used in this
way.
